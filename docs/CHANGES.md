## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Pusher Credentials
1. Sign up at https://pusher.com/ (free)
2. Create a new Channels app
3. Copy: App ID, Key, Secret, Cluster

### Step 2: Update .env.local
```env
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test It!
- Open app in two browser tabs
- Add a task in one tab
- See notification in both tabs! 🎉

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before ❌
- No real-time updates between devices
- AI didn't know current date/time
- Had to refresh to see changes from other devices
- Scheduling suggestions were not time-aware

### After ✅
- Instant notifications across all devices
- AI knows current date: Oct 30, 2025
- See changes immediately without refresh
- Smart, time-aware scheduling recommendations

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

1. **Multi-device Sync**: Open on phone and laptop, changes sync instantly
2. **Better Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm every action
3. **Smarter AI**: Knows what time it is, schedules appropriately
4. **Professional UX**: Real-time updates like modern SaaS apps
